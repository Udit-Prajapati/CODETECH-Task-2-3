# Duration: December 17th, 2024 - February 17th, 2025
# Mentor: Muzammil Ahmed
# Overview
The task involves migrating data from one database system (e.g., MySQL) to another (e.g., PostgreSQL) while maintaining data integrity. The project aims to ensure seamless data transfer and address potential challenges, such as schema conversion, datatype compatibility, and performance optimization.
# Key Activities
Database Analysis and Planning:

Assess the source (MySQL) and target (PostgreSQL) databases.
Identify differences in schema structures, datatypes, and constraints.
Schema Conversion:

Convert MySQL schema to PostgreSQL schema using migration tools or manual adjustments.
Map datatypes and handle unsupported features.
Data Migration:

Extract data from MySQL.
Transform data as necessary for compatibility with PostgreSQL.
Load data into PostgreSQL using scripts or ETL tools.
Data Validation and Integrity Checks:

Verify data consistency between source and target databases.
Validate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize queries and indexes in PostgreSQL.
Address any latency or performance bottlenecks.
Documentation and Reporting:

Prepare migration scripts and summarize the entire process in a detailed report.
Technology Used
Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
# Tools:
pgAdmin, DBeaver, or similar for database management
Migration tools such as AWS DMS, pgLoader, or manual SQL scripts
Python/Java for scripting and ETL tasks (if needed)
Validation: SQL queries for data comparison and integrity checks
# Key Insights
Schema Compatibility: Handling differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL schemas is crucial for a smooth migration.
Datatype Mapping: Some MySQL datatypes require careful mapping or transformation in PostgreSQL.
Integrity Maintenance: Ensuring referential integrity and consistency during migration is vital.
Performance Tuning: Optimizing indexes and queries in PostgreSQL improves the overall system performance post-migration.
Learning Opportunity: Gained practical experience in database migration and troubleshooting.
